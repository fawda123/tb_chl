Enclosed please find our revised manuscript, entitled `Adaptation of a weighted regression approach to evaluate water quality trends in an estuary', to be reconsidered as an original research article in Environmental Modeling and Assessment.  We greatly appreciate the comments from the associate editor and two anonymous reviewers.  Our responses to these comments have been included as a separate document with our re-submission.  We are confident that these revisions have improved content of the manuscript, particularly regarding the treatment of censored values, inclusion of censored quantile regression, and improved description of model performance.  

Please do not hesitate to contact us with questions regarding our revision.  As before, we have compiled the manuscript using a \LaTeX\ document preparation system with the Springer template and can provide source files if needed.  We greatly appreciate the opportunity to publish our work in Environmental Modeling and Assessment.\vspace{0.5in}

\hspace{4.5in}Respectfully,

\hspace{4.5in}Marcus W. Beck
